## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

This is my first project in The Odin Project Foundations course.  It builds on HTML skills by creating a main index page that has links to different recipe pages.

### Continued development

The rise in AI sparked the idea for an AI recipes project where users could prompt AI to give them a recipe based on the ingredients in their kitchen.  This type of project would require building out a backend and working with OpenAI's API.  As I gain backend skills, I would love to make this application a reality.  Stay tuned.

### Useful resources

- [Bulletproof @font-face Syntax](https://www.paulirish.com/2009/bulletproof-font-face-implementation-syntax/) - Great resource for @font-face definitions.
