## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

This is my first project in The Odin Project Foundations course.  It builds on HTML skills by creating a main index page that has links to different recipe pages.

Through this project, I was able to incorporate many of the HTML and CSS concepts I learned back in [Interneting Is Hard](https://www.internetingishard.com/).

For example, I got to work with advanced positioning when creating the dropdown menu.  I also got to work with `@media` queries to make this project responsive.

As for The Odin Project portion, I got to practice building a site with both relative and absolute links.  The header menu, footer attribution, and home page recipes all included links.  I definitely got my taste of double checking that all the links are good to go, both for paths to images and paths to another page.

A bonus trick I learned was the `object-fit: cover` property for images.  This, along with `aspect-ratio` helped me keep my images uniform.

### Continued development

The rise in AI sparked the idea for an AI recipes project where users could prompt AI to give them a recipe based on the ingredients in their kitchen.  This type of project would require building out a backend and working with OpenAI's API.  As I gain backend skills, I would love to make this application a reality.  Stay tuned.

### Useful resources

- [Bulletproof @font-face Syntax](https://www.paulirish.com/2009/bulletproof-font-face-implementation-syntax/) - Great resource for @font-face definitions.

- [Interneting Is Hard - Advanced Positioning](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/advanced-positioning/) - One of my hands down favorite resources for HTML and CSS, especially when it comes to advanced topics such as positioning.

- [DigialOcean - How to Scale and Crop Images with CSS object-fit](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-cropping-images-object-fit) - Super helpful explanation of `object-fit` values with visual examples.
